# Why Async? (Or, Why is JavaScript Single-threaded?)

## Multi-threaded programming is hard to get right
* Managing shared data
* Synchronization

## Many threads means
*  many execution stacks -> memory
* context switching -> CPU

<br/><br/>

## Browsers
* Load quickly (or appear to) - manage network requests, render early
* Smooth interaction -> responsive to events

## Node
* Optimize for I/O
* Maximize throughput (getting work done)

<br/><br/>

## Language Support
This line of code implies the entire process blocks, or there are multiple execution stacks:

```javascript
result = db.query('select...');
```

This line of code implies an event loop:

```javascript
db.query('select...', (result) => {
  // do something with results
});
```

<br/>

## JavaScript ideal language for both environments
* Designed for event programming
* Closures
* Anonymous functions
